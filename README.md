ðŸ“¦ Technical Notes
Encoding: Sets the console to UTF-8 (chcp 65001) for proper Unicode support.

Robust Flow Control: Uses delayed variable expansion (setlocal enabledelayedexpansion) and input validation to ensure smooth operation.

Error Handling: If downloads fail or invalid options are selected, the script shows error messages and returns to the appropriate menu.
